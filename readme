Quick Notes for Each Question
.............................
1. Two Sum
Use a hash map to store numbers and indices.
Check if target - currentNumber exists.
Efficient solution in O(n) time.

2. Valid Parentheses
Use a stack to track opening brackets.
Match each closing bracket with the last opened one.
Ensures correct and balanced parentheses.

3. Palindrome Check
Reverse the string and compare it with the original.
If both are same, the string is a palindrome.

4. FizzBuzz
Loop from 1 to n.
Print:
“Fizz” if divisible by 3
“Buzz” if divisible by 5
“FizzBuzz” if divisible by both

5. Merge Two Sorted Arrays
Use two pointers to compare both arrays.
Add the smaller value to the result.
Produces a merged sorted array.

6. Remove Duplicates
Use a Set to store unique values.
Convert the set back to an array.

7. First Non-Repeating Character
Count occurrences of each character using an object.
Return the index of the first character with count 1.

8. Reverse a String
Split the string into characters.
Reverse and join them back.

9. Anagram Check
Two strings are anagrams if they have:
Same characters
Same frequency
Use a character count object to compare.

10. Flatten Nested Array
Extract elements from nested arrays into a single array.
Use loops or recursion to flatten.

11. Count Occurrences of Array Elements
Loop through array and store element counts in an object.
Return the object with key-value pairs.

12. Find Maximum and Minimum
Loop through array once.
Track the highest and lowest values manually.
