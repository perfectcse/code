🧠 Quick Interview Notes (Important)
1. Two Sum
Use a hash map
Store values to find complements
Optimized solution → O(n)

2. Valid Parentheses
Use a stack
Opening brackets pushed
Closing brackets must match last opened

3. Palindrome Check
String should read the same forward and backward
Compare original and reversed string

4. FizzBuzz
Loop from 1 to n
Divisible by 3 → Fizz
Divisible by 5 → Buzz
Both → FizzBuzz

5. Merge Two Sorted Arrays
Use two pointers
Compare elements from both arrays
Result remains sorted
Time → O(n + m)

6. Remove Duplicates
Use Set
Set stores only unique values

7. First Non-Repeating Character
Count character frequencies

Return index of first character with count = 1

8. Reverse a String
Convert string to characters
Reverse order
Join back to string

9. Anagram Check
Same length required
Same characters with same frequency
Order does not matter

10. Flatten Nested Array
Extract elements from nested arrays
Convert into a single flat array
Loop or recursion can be used
11. Count Occurrences in Array

Use object as counter
Element → key
Frequency → value

12. Find Max and Min
Initialize both with first element
Compare while looping
Track largest and smallest

13. Check if Array Is Sorted
Compare each element with next
If any element is greater → not sorted
Otherwise sorted

14. Intersection of Two Arrays
Count elements of one array
Check matches in second array
Handle duplicates correctly

15. Sum of Array Elements
Initialize sum = 0
Add each element
Empty array → return 0

16. Character Frequency in String
Loop through string
Count each character
Uppercase and lowercase treated differently

17. Find Longest Word
Split string into words
Compare word lengths
Return the longest word

18. Group Array of Objects by Key
Use object for grouping
Key value decides the group
Store objects in arrays under each key
